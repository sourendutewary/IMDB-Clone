Movie Search and Favorites Project
This project is a simple web application that allows users to search for movies using the OMDB API and save their favorite movies.

Features
Movie Search: Users can search for movies by title using the search bar.
Live Search Results: As users type in the search bar, search results are dynamically displayed.
Favorites: Users can add movies to their favorites list by clicking on the "Add to Favorites" button.
Viewing Favorite Movies: Users can view their favorite movies on a separate page.
Removing from Favorites: Users can remove movies from their favorites list.
How it Works
The project uses HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for the frontend.
It fetches movie data from the OMDB API to display search results and movie details.
User favorite movies are stored locally in the browser's localStorage.
The application is structured using modular JavaScript to handle different functionalities separately.
Usage
Enter a movie title in the search bar and press Enter or click the search button.
Browse through the search results and click on a movie to view details.
To add a movie to favorites, click the "Add to Favorites" button.
To view favorite movies, navigate to the Favorites page.
To remove a movie from favorites, click the "Remove Favorite" button on the Favorites page.
Conclusion
Project Understanding: I was able to understand the project from the get-go as I have experience in React. Rendering part was easy, and also the fetching part.
Navigation Confusion: When I had to open movie details, I was confused about how to do that as in React I have React Router, but here I had to use window.location.href. Although I know about this method, I forgot since I haven't used it in so long. This project in React will be far easier to build.

Challenging Experience: The challenge was good to warm up my JavaScript skills. This is basically the main work of a frontend developer: making UI and animations and rendering things using backend APIs.
